To make an app var of a (1 page only!) app:

use app2var.sh if on Mac/Linux
use the Windows To8xv folder if on Windows (thanks to OffSiab)
Alternatively prgmTEST2 (by brandonw) will use the number in Ans as a page number for an application and will store the entire application in an ~16KB appvar called APP. Use Calcsys (Menu options: 6 -> 1 -> 3) to get the page number of the application you want to store. The page number returned by Calcsys is HEX!

ti82a(reformat_0C-1B).82u is a modified OS update file to delete all apps if you mess up something. It was created by critor.
